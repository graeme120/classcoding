        <div class="block">
        In this light, perhaps one has to redefine the value of the image, or, more 
        precisely, to create a new perspective for it. Apart from resolution and 
        exchange value, one might imagine another form of value defined by velocity, 
        intensity, and spread. Poor images are poor because they are heavily compressed 
        and travel quickly. They lose matter and gain speed. But they also express a 
        condition of dematerialization, shared not only with the legacy of conceptual 
        art but above all with contemporary modes of semiotic production. Capital's semiotic 
        turn, as described by Felix Guattari, plays in favor of the creation and dissemination
        of compressed and flexible data packages that can be integrated into ever-newer 
        combinations and sequences.
